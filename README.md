## 1. Introduction

In this section there is some code for Middle Test Python Use Case Astra Data Scientist Bootcamp Batch 2. The dataset consist of water usage, apartment price in Victoria, and titanic accident.
### 1.1 Water Usage
The task is to predict the survival on the Titanic based on the dataset of the onboard passengers of the historical journey embarked on April 15, 1912. The features include Gender, Age, Passenger class, Ticket Fare, Port of Embarkation, Family, etc. It requires a binary classification of 1/0, 1 meaning Survived and 0 meaning not survived. The input dataset has been split into training and testing sets which are available to the public through Kaggle. The output requirement is a CSV file with 2 columns - PassengerID and Survival prediction (1/0).<br>

*The Dataset provides the annual water usage in Baltimore from 1885 to 1963*, or 79 years of data. The values are in the units of liters per capita per day, and there are 79 observations.<br>

### 1.2 Apartment Price in Victoria
Apartment in Victoria has different price. The Victorian Property Sales Report is released quarterly in March, June, September and December. It covers median sale prices by suburb for houses, units and vacant land over a period of 15 months. The report lists the percentage shift in median prices between quarters as well as the change over a 12-month period. An overall Melbourne metropolitan median sale price and country Victoria median sale price are also included for each property type. The Victorian Valuer-General provides a summary of activity and highlights where the most significant price changes have occurred. <br>

*The Dataset provides living area and conservation status.* There are 218 observations and 16 variables. <br>

### 1.3 Titanic Sank
On April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.<br>

*The dataset contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers*. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (S), their age (A), their passenger-class (C), their sex (G) and the fare they paid (X). The table below shows the Data Dictionary. <br>
